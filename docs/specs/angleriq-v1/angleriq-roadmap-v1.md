# 1. Roadmap Philosophy

AnglerIQ scales in **predictable, revenue-aligned phases**:

- V1 = Foundation + UX + core logic
- V2 = High-value environmental intelligence
- V3 = Data ingestion + personalization
- V4 = Predictive modeling
- V5 = Full spatial/sonar analysis

Each version builds on prior logic without rewriting the system.

# 2. V1 — CURRENT (Basic + Pro Logic)

Status: **Shipped**

Deliverables:

- Basic tier
- Pro tier
- Deterministic logic
- Summaries powered by shared LLM
- Mobile-first UI
- Clean schemas
- Full backend routes
- Test coverage

Outcome:

- Reliable, consistent patterns
- Strong UX and clarity
- Stable foundation for expansion

---

# 3. V2 — Environmental Intelligence (High ROI)

Status: **Planned**

New inputs:

- Wind
- Sun/cloud
- Weather trend
- Barometric pressure
- Rain/Front activity
- Seasonal forage alignment (dynamic)

New features:

- “Daily pattern modulation”
- More accurate Pro recommendations
- Local forage-season mapping
- Wind-influenced structure targeting

Why V2 matters:

- These inputs drastically increase accuracy
- Zero new hardware required
- Easy to sell
- Zero LLM risk — still deterministic-first

---

# 4. V3 — Weather API Integration + User Profile Memory

Status: **Planned**

Add:

- GPS-based weather ingestion
- Automatic temp/wind/barometer
- User-catch memory
- “Personalized confidence scoring”
- Pattern accuracy tracker
- Historical conditions archive

Enables:

- Auto-fill conditions for faster patterns
- “How accurate were we last time?” features
- Premium retention mechanisms

---

# 5. V4 — Predictive Pattern Modeling

Status: Spec only

Adds:

- Predictive time windows (“best 2-hour feeding window”)
- Trend modeling (rising/falling temp, wind shifts)
- Short-term pattern prediction
- “If you can only fish 2 hours today…” recommendations

Requires:

- A historical condition database
- On-device caching
- Lightweight ML or rules-based trend models

---

# 6. V5 — Sonar + Spatial Intelligence (The Endgame)

Status: Concept

This is the flagship future tier.

Adds:

- Sonar-log ingestion
- Structure detection (brush, rock, bait clouds)
- Fish density scoring
- Depth/time heatmaps
- Real-time adaptive guidance

Enables:

- “You’re moving too fast — slow down 10 ft.”
- “Target the left side of this creek bend.”
- Full AR fishing assistant (long-term vision)

This is where AnglerIQ becomes an **elite-tier fishing AI assistant**.

# 7. Monetization Alignment by Version

| Version | Monetization Fit | Reason                           |
| ------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **V1**  | Free or Low-Tier | Low compute, high utility        |
| **V2**  | Mid-tier         | High value accuracy improvements |
| **V3**  | Premium          | Auto-weather, personalized data  |
| **V4**  | Premium+         | Predictive features              |
| **V5**  | Flagship         | Hardware + cloud + subscriptions |

---

# 8. Release Strategy Summary

**V1 → V2**: Add environmental depth  
**V2 → V3**: Add automation + personalization  
**V3 → V4**: Add prediction  
**V4 → V5**: Add spatial intelligence

Each step builds on stable deterministic logic.
